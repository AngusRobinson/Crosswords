# Tracking and analysing my crossword solving.

The Guardian publishes a *Quiptic* or "Quick Cryptic" crossword once a week since 1999, all available online [here](https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/series/quiptic). I have been going through from the very beginning, and timing my solves. 

**Quiptic_tracker.csv** is where I record my times, under the scheme that if I make a mistake or have to reveal an answer, I add 5 minutes to my final time.

**Quiptic_analysis.r** is the script that I run periodically to analyse the data I record and produce graphs, which I save in **Charts**.
